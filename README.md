The "Customer Churn Analysis" project aims to understand and predict customer churn using a dataset containing demographic, service usage, and account information. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data visualization, and potentially predictive modeling (depending on the stage of the project).

Key findings indicate that contract type, monthly charges, and tenure are critical factors in determining churn likelihood, with month-to-month contracts and higher charges correlating with higher churn rates. The project structure is clean, and the notebook provides a logical flow from data loading to insights.
